She was born on the 29th of March 1999, and according to records, her place of birth was in Dallas, Texas, where she spent most of her early life. Clark Hunt, the chairman and CEO of the Kansas City Chiefs, and his wife, Tavia Shackles, are her parents. Tavia used to be a cheerleader and beauty pageant contestant. In 1993, she was crowned Miss Kansas USA and then finished first runner-up in Miss US pageantry.&nbsp;</span></p><p>A citizen of the United States of America, Gracia Hunt is a white American. Thus, she belongs to the Caucasian ethnic group of the country. Gracie is from a wealthy family and has some well-known relatives. Her paternal grandpa Lamar Hunt was a Pro Football Hall of Famer. He was largely responsible for creating Major League Soccer and the American Football League, respectively, in 1959 and 1993.</p><p>While details about her early life and upbringing are not readily available, we know that Gracie Hunt was raised in a religious home. According to some reports, she has held on to the tenets of her religion as an adult. She has been described in some quarters as a devout Christian.</p><h3><strong>Where was Gracie Hunt College Education?</strong></h3><p>Gracie Hunt received her college education at Southern Methodist University. While information regarding her early education is scarce, it has been confirmed that she attended and graduated from Southern Methodist University. Not long after she left college, Gracie began pursuing a modeling career, which has paid off for her.</p><h2><strong>Meet Gracie Hunt’s Father, Clark Knobel Hunt</strong></h2><p>Gracie Hunt’s father is the owner of the Kansas City Chiefs, but there is more to who the man is. Clark is a reputable businessman, the son of Lamar Hunt and the grandson of H.L. Hunt, who was an oil baron. His father was one of the founding members of the American Football League and also founded the Chiefs. Clark Hunt has been associated with the Kansas City Chiefs for more than 20 years. And for more than half of those years, he has served as the CEO of the organization. Under his watch, the Chiefs have progressed to become one of the most prosperous clubs in the NFL.</p><p>Remarkably, Gracie Hunt’s father has twice won the Lamar Hunt Trophy. The accolade named after his father is a coveted award, and he received it for leading the Chiefs to two AFC titles. This was back-to-back in 2019 and 2020, the first time the franchise would pull off such a feat in its history. They won the Super Bowl LIV of the 2019 season to cap it all. All in all, Grace Hunt’s father is very accomplished and is estimated to have a net worth of at least $2 billion.</p><h2><strong>Does Gracie Hunt Have Siblings?</strong></h2><p>Gracie Hunt has two siblings, a brother, and a sister. The American model is not the only child of her parents but the first of the three children her parents have. So, she has a younger sister named Ava Hunt and a younger brother named Knobel Hunt. Knobel is also popular as he is an athlete and involved in the family’s business.</p><p>Much is not known about the youngest sibling, Ava Hunt, as she stays away from the spotlight. But she is quite popular and has been following her mother’s and elder sister’s footprints. A cheerleader and member of the National Cheerleaders Association, Ava won the Miss Preteen Texas International pageantry in 2018. In 2021, she finished in the top three of the Miss Texas pageant. That was the same year her sister was crowned as Miss Kansas USA.</p><h2><strong>Clark Hunt’s Daughter, Gracie Hunt, Has Been Contesting in Beauty Pageants Since Her Teenage Years</strong></h2><p>The American model was crowned Miss Kansas USA in April 2021. Later that year, in November, she finished among the top 16 in the Miss USA pageant. Gracie Hunt has been competing in pageantries since her teenage years. In 2016, when she was 17, she won the Miss Texas Teen International title. Two years later, at the age of 19, she won the Miss Texas International title. This was in 2018.</p><p>Building on the popularity that came with the pageantries she won, Gracie Hunt launched her career as a social media influencer. She now commands thousands of followers on Instagram and Twitter. Growing up, she played soccer and probably wanted to play at a professional level. She gave up the dream after suffering a series of concussions and is now focused on being a model and a social media influencer.</p><p>In addition to that, she is a blogger. Being an enterprising woman, Hunt sells cosmetics, clothing, and various fashion accessories through her blog, www.graciehunt.komi.io. A good measure of the proceeds she realizes from this goes to children in need. She is the founder of Breaking Barriers Through Sports, a charity organization committed to helping kids have a sense of purpose.</p><p><b>Social Media Accounts</b></p><h2><strong>Who Is Grace Hunt’s Husband or Boyfriend?</strong></h2><p>Grace Hunt does not have a husband and is not currently dating.
