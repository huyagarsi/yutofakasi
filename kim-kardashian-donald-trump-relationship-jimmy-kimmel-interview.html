Comments</h2><p>While Kim Kardashian talked about Donald Trump on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, there is a lot more to the story of their relationship. It's important to note that things started out well between the two... but their relationship was a negative one before her comments on Kimmel. According to Business Insider, <strong>Kim Kardashian and Donald Trump talked about criminal justice reform </strong>at the White House in 2018 and 2020. In 2018, Trump tweeted, "Great meeting with @KimKardashian today, talked about prison reform and sentencing."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ttweb_kim-kardashian-s-jimmy-kimmel-interview-reminded-fans-of-these-wild-and-perplexing-rumors_bk_a1.jpg><p>Business Insider reported that Donald Trump was then angry when Kim Kardashian asked him to release someone from prison, he said, according to the book "Tired Of Winning" by Jonathan Karl:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Hell no.

This was several years before her April 2024 Jimmy Kimmel live! interview and proof that their relationship soured after they initially seemed to get along.

Trump tweeted:</p><p>“In the ‘book’ he has the World’s most overrated celebrity, Kim Kardashian, supposedly telling me that she ‘would leverage her celebrity to get football stars to come to the White House,’ if I would commute the sentences of various prisoners.
