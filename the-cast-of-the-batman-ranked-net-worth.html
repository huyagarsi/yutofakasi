Day by day, the fans of The Caped Crusader, and great films, in general, are falling in love with the creative choices director Matt Reeves has seemingly made for his take on the world of Gotham. This includes the dark noir look, which harkens back to the best Detective Comics and even Batman: The Animated Series, and the gritty and serious feel that screams Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy. Then, of course, there's the casting...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Every Batman movie has received backlash for one casting choice or another. The flack that Heath Ledger received before fans actually saw his Oscar-winning work as The Joker in The Dark Knight, was ridiculous. The same is true for numerous actors in The Batman. But now that a few constantly strong trailers have been released, fans have accepted Robert Pattinson as their new Batman, Zoe Kravitz as their new Catwoman, and even Colin Farrell as their new Penguin. And there's no doubt that each of these actors is thrilled to be taking on their respective roles as it has increased their net worths. Here's what each cast member of The Batman is worth prior to the release of the new film...</p><h2 id=rupert-penry-jones-is-worth-1-7-million><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Rupert Penry-Jones Is Worth $1.7 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rupert Penry-Jones' role in The Batman may be small, but it seems absolutely vital to the plot. After all, he's playing the mayor who The Riddler brutally takes out in the trailer. Therefore, much of the murder-mystery plot will revolve around this British-born actor. Aside from the upcoming DC movie, Rupert is best known for his role in Spooks, Wizards, and Black Sails. There is no precise consensus on his exact net worth as some sites claim it's $1.5 million and others say it's closer to $17 million. But the most reliable say it's around $1.7 million.</p><h2 id=alex-ferns-is-worth-1---5-million><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Alex Ferns Is Worth $1 - 5 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Scottish actor has been prolific in the television industry in the UK for years. Most notable are his roles in EastEnders, River City, Wolfblood, and Rhodes. He also had a major part in HBO's Chernobyl. But The Batman will be his biggest project to date and will almost definitely up his net worth drastically. He will be playing Commissioner Pete Savage.</p><h2 id=max-and-charlie-carver-are-worth-2-million-each><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Max And Charlie Carver Are Worth $2 Million Each</span></h2><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, the identical twins are both worth around $2 million. While their roles in The Batman are not yet known, they are most recognized for their roles in Desperate Housewives, Teen Wolf, and The Leftovers.</p><h2 id=barry-keoghan-is-worth-between-5---12-million><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Barry Keoghan Is Worth Between $5 - $12 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There's a lot of <a href=#>mystery around Barry Keoghan's role in The Batman</a>. His character wasn't even present in certain test screenings for the movie. But, according to MovieWeb, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">word on the street is that he's playing The Joker</a> in a small part that will set up the sequel to The Batman. On IMDb, his character is said to be Officer Staley Merkel. Whether that's true or not remains to be seen. But there's no doubt that Barry has become one of the most celebrated young actors over the past few years. With roles in Dunkirk, The Eternals, The Killing Of A Sacred Deer, The Green Knight, and many many more. There's an array of information out there about his net worth... most conflicting. But he's worth somewhere between $5 and $12 million.</p><h2 id=jeffrey-wright-is-worth-8-million><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Jeffrey Wright Is Worth $8 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jeffrey Wright is absolutely everywhere nowadays. And that makes it slightly surprising that Celebrity Net Worth claims he's only worth $8 million. Whether this number is accurate or not there's no doubt that his net worth is going to continue to skyrocket thanks to his role as James Gordon In The Batman and the next season of Westworld. He's also known for his role as Felix Leiter in The James Bond movies, The French Dispatch, Marvels' What If?, The Hunger Games movies, The Ides of March, Boardwalk Empire, and Angels In America.</p><h2 id=paul-dano-is-worth-10-million><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Paul Dano Is Worth $10 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Paul Dano doesn't seem to be the type of guy who has ever taken a role for the money. This is why he's one of the most respected actors in the business. His precision at picking strong, if not somewhat obscure, projects is remarkable. He's best known for his work in Prisoners, 1 Years A Slave, There Will Be Blood, Swiss Army Man, and Little Miss Sunshine. But his upcoming role as The Riddler will no doubt send his career and his $10 million net worth into the stratosphere.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>â€˜The Batmanâ€™: Selina Kyle Aka Catwoman Has Nine Lives</a></span></p><h2 id=zoe-kravitz-is-worth-10-million><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Zoe Kravitz Is Worth $10 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With every role that Zoe Kravitz has taken, her star power and net worth have skyrocketed. Of course, the $10 million that Celebrity Net Worth claims she has is completely due to her own career choices. It's not taking into consideration the humungous net worth her father, Lenny Kravitz, or other famous family members, such as Jason Mamoa, have. Zoe is best known for her work in Big Little Lies, Mad Max, X-Men: First Class, Divergent, and Californication. There's no doubt that playing Selina Kyle/Catwoman will solidify her deserved position as a leading woman.</p><h2 id=john-turturro-is-worth-14-million><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>John Turturro Is Worth $14 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's no surprise that John Turturro's net worth is listed at $14 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. Since the beginning of his epic career in Hollywood, John has been known as one of the best character actors in the business. Of course, his talents have allowed him to take on vastly different parts in projects like O'Brother Where Art Thou?, The Transformers movies, The Big Lebowski, Cars 2, You Don't Mess With The Zohan, Barton Fink and his utterly stellar work in The Night Of. He will be playing the role of the villainous mobster, Carmine Falcone.</p><h2 id=andy-serkis-is-worth-18-million><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Andy Serkis Is Worth $18 Million</span></h2><p>No one should be surprised by the size of Andy Serkis' net worth. His unquestionably iconic roles in The Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, the Planet of the Apes series, King Kong, and Black Panther are the reason he's made so much money. But Andy also has a notable career in directing, recently helming Venom: Let There Be Carnage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Actors Who Played Batman: Which One Is The Richest In 2021?</a></span></p><h2 id=peter-saarsgard-is-worth-25-million><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Peter Saarsgard Is Worth $25 Million</span></h2><p>There's no doubt that Peter Saarsgard's role in The Batman is larger than it may appear. That's because he's one of the most celebrated actors of his generation. Thanks to roles in Jarhead, Dopesick, The Killing, Blue Jasmine, and An Education. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Peter is sitting happy on a whopping $25 million. Pair that with the humungous net worth of his wife, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and you're looking at one of the wealthiest cast members of The Batman.,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=colin-farrell-is-worth-80-million><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Colin Farrell Is Worth $80 Million</span></h2><p>People still can't stop talking about Colin Farrell's unrecognizable look as The Penguin in The Batman. Especially given the fact that he's known for playing the good-looking leading man. While Colin has made a lot of money from starring in blockbusters like Daredevil, Dumbo, Alexander, Fantastic Beasts, and Total Recall, he's also been in some hugely successful indie films like In Burges, Seven Psychopaths, The Lobster, The Killing of a Sacred Deer, and The Beguiled. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Colin is worth $80 million.</p><h2><span class=item-num>2 </span><span></span></h2><h2 id=robert-pattinson-is-worth-100-million><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Robert Pattinson Is Worth $100 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Twilight, anyone? This is, without a doubt, the main reason Robert Pattinson is worthy of such an incredible amount of money. Then, of course, there are his roles in Harry Potter and Tenet. But Robert loves making far more serious films like The King, The Lighthouse, High Life, and Cosmopolis. Regardless of the movie, Robert has become one of the most beloved and respected actors working today. There's no wonder fans are ready to accept him as their new Batman. They were even surprised that he was <a href=#>only paid $3 million for the movie</a>...</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Zoe Kravitz Claims Robert Pattinson's Jawline Contributes To Him Being A Great Batman</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dmK60wIyonWasmJp6o63TppinZaKWu6yxw2alnqxdrLyzwMdo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-cast-of-the-batman-ranked-net-worth.html&text=The%20Cast%20Of%20%27The%20Batman%27%20Ranked%20By%20Net%20Worth%20&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-cast-of-the-batman-ranked-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-cast-of-the-batman-ranked-net-worth.html&title=The%20Cast%20Of%20%27The%20Batman%27%20Ranked%20By%20Net%20Worth%20" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-cast-of-the-batman-ranked-net-worth.html&title=The%20Cast%20Of%20%27The%20Batman%27%20Ranked%20By%20Net%20Worth%20" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-cast-of-the-batman-ranked-net-worth.html&title=The%20Cast%20Of%20%27The%20Batman%27%20Ranked%20By%20Net%20Worth%20" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-cast-of-the-batman-ranked-net-worth.html&description=The%20Cast%20Of%20%27The%20Batman%27%20Ranked%20By%20Net%20Worth%20" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./topless-stars-celebs-whove-gone-near-naked-2013317.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Topless Stars: Celebs Who've Gone Near-Naked">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./tekashi-69s-former-gang-affiliates-are-found-guilty-following-the-rappers-snitching-326737.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tekashi 69s Former Gang Affiliates Are Found Guilty Following The Rappers Snitching">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
