She worked for the London-based WFTV (Women in Film and Television) Channel 9 and has won two Emmy Awards.</p><p>Angela Jacobs of the Orlando Channel 9 died of breast cancer that spread to other parts of her body.</p><p>The page for her channel said that her character was “fiercely loyal” because she was so loyal. Angela Jacobs, an anchor for Channel 9, died Tuesday night after a brave battle with breast cancer that spread to other parts of her body.</p><p>Angela Jacobs didn’t talk about her cancer until 2020, when she made a video to talk about it for the first time. She talked about what she did to help people understand how geneticists solve DNA puzzles to stop breast cancer in its tracks.</p><p>Angela went through 56 rounds of radiation and chemotherapy, a blood transfusion, and four surgeries during her fight. When Jacobs finally got better, he was in remission for more than two years. But this year, cancer came back early. She went through another hard fight while getting chemo and other cutting-edge treatments.</p><p>Anchor Greg Warmoth said about her, “She had a strong belief in God and heaven, and I know in my heart that she is in heaven now and not in pain.”</p><h2>Angela Jacobs was how old? How old you were when you died</h2><p>Angela Jacobs, who works as a reporter and anchor for WFTV in the United States, was born in Orlando, Florida, about 40 years ago.</p><p>She was very secretive about her personal life and never told the media anything about herself. Based on how she looks and acts, it’s likely that she is in her early 40s.</p><p>Angela Jacobs went to the College of Missouri-Columbia and got her master’s in journalism in 2013. Angela Jacobs has wanted to be a sports anchor and tell the sports news for as long as she can remember. She was also a dog lover.</p><p>Angela Jacobs began her work life at a very young age. When she died, many of her coworkers and friends paid tribute to her and told her family and friends how sorry they were.</p><h2>Details about Angela Jacobs’s husband and family are in her personal life</h2><p>Angela’s mother has been fighting breast cancer for 16 years. She is now living with her family.</p><p>Angela said that when doctors found a cancerous tumor in her right breast, she thought she would have surgery but not chemotherapy or radiation like her mother did.</p><p>She often posted on Instagram about her mother and father, but there was no sign of or news about her husband. So, no one knows for sure if the Orlando native was married or not.</p><h2>How much did Angela Jacobs have in her bank account?</h2><p>The Famous Data says that Angela Jacobs, a reporter for Channel 9, makes $71,375 a year and has a net worth of $899,368.</p><p>She won two regional Emmys and a number of other awards for her work in Tampa Bay, where she was known for doing confidential interviews with some of the best-known pro athletes and head coaches in the Bay Area. I</p><p>Angela was a guest co-host on NBC Sports Network for a week after covering the Rays and Lightning for Fox Sports Florida from 2008 to 2013.</p><p>Jacobs worked as a sports reporter at WTSP in Tampa Bay for nine years. In February 2013, he became a general assignment reporter at WFTV. During her career, she wrote about hurricanes, major sports events like the Super Bowl and World Series, and more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJrBorjKrKuonJGue6S7zGiYp5%2BVoa5utsCcppurXaS%2Fra3NnaZmm5iWu6%2Bxy2ZwZpyVlsGpecWrpqZlnZrBor%2FTmquim12Xv6at0q1knJmemLKzew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fangela-jacobs-orlando-channel-9-death-from-metastatic-breast-cancer.html&text=Angela%20Jacobs%20Orlando%20Channel%209%20Death%20From%20Metastatic%20Breast%20Cancer%20The%20Talks%20Today&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fangela-jacobs-orlando-channel-9-death-from-metastatic-breast-cancer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fangela-jacobs-orlando-channel-9-death-from-metastatic-breast-cancer.html&title=Angela%20Jacobs%20Orlando%20Channel%209%20Death%20From%20Metastatic%20Breast%20Cancer%20The%20Talks%20Today" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fangela-jacobs-orlando-channel-9-death-from-metastatic-breast-cancer.html&title=Angela%20Jacobs%20Orlando%20Channel%209%20Death%20From%20Metastatic%20Breast%20Cancer%20The%20Talks%20Today" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fangela-jacobs-orlando-channel-9-death-from-metastatic-breast-cancer.html&title=Angela%20Jacobs%20Orlando%20Channel%209%20Death%20From%20Metastatic%20Breast%20Cancer%20The%20Talks%20Today" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fangela-jacobs-orlando-channel-9-death-from-metastatic-breast-cancer.html&description=Angela%20Jacobs%20Orlando%20Channel%209%20Death%20From%20Metastatic%20Breast%20Cancer%20The%20Talks%20Today" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./10045109-celtics-legend-bill-russells-no-6-jersey-to-be-permanently-retired-by-nba.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Celtics Legend Bill Russell's No. 6 Jersey to Be Permanently Retired by NBA | News, Scores, Highligh">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-polina-pushkareva-meet-warhunt-cast-on-instagram.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Polina Pushkareva?
