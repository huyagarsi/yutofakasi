At the hour of composing, Saša Dončić was unattached, albeit that measurement can change at any point in the near future.</p><p>What is Luka Dončić’s Mother’s Age? Luka Dončić’s mother, Mirjam Poterbin, is 48 years of age. Like her child and ex, Mirjam Poterbin was born in Ljubljana, Slovenia.</p><p>Not much is realized about the superstar mother’s dad, Anton Poterbin, however her mom, Milena Poterbin, was a stylist.</p><p>There has been no notice of Mirjam’s kin, and that has prompted the presumption that she is the lone offspring of her folks.</p><p>Mirjam is a knowledgeable lady who sacked a Policy implementation degree from the College of Ljubljana.
