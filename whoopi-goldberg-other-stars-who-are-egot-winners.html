While we consider an Oscar win quite the feat or a <a href=#>slew of Grammy nominations</a> a huge deal, nothing quite comes close to taking home the four biggest awards in the entertainment biz.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>These Male Artists Have Won The Most Grammy's</a></span></p><p>Although Whoopi Goldberg is known for being an EGOT winner, there are a few other big names who have <a href=#>recently come to win an EGOT</a>, too. So, which other Hollywood figures landed themselves members of such an exclusive group? Let's dive in!</p><h2 id=whoopi-goldberg><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Whoopi Goldberg</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whoopi Goldberg is no stranger to the spotlight! The star has revolutionized the industry as we know it, and while acting hasn't been her main priority since joining The View, her career certainly speaks for itself. Whoopi took home her very first Grammy back in 1986, followed by her 1991 Oscar win for Best Supporting Actress in Ghost.</p><p>In 2002, Whoopi finally <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">secured her EGOT</a> after taking home both a Tony and Emmy the same award season, scoring her the esteemed title in only 16 years of being under the spotlight!</p><h2 id=rita-moreno><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Rita Moreno</span></h2><p>Rita Moreno has been singing, dancing, and acting since her days back on Broadway when she was only 13 years old! The star has remained active in the industry, appearing on the hit series, One Day At A Time, alongside Justina Machado.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During her glory days, earning a Grammy, Tony, and Emmy in 1972, 1975, and 1977 respectively. This allowed Moreno to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">officially become an EGOT member</a>, considering she had taken home an Oscar nearly a decade prior in 1961.</p><h2 id=audrey-hepburn><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Audrey Hepburn</span></h2><p>Audrey Hepburn is without a doubt one of the biggest names to have reigned in Hollywood. The stars take on Breakfast At Tiffany's<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">earned Hepburn her icon status,</a> and rightfully so! Audrey won an Oscar in 1953, and a Tony in 1954.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Breakfast At Tiffany's' Made Audrey Hepburn An Icon</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While she had every accolade and award there was, it wasn't until the '90s that she won the remaining two awards to secure her EGOT status. In 1993, Audrey won her first Emmy for Garden's Of The World, and only a year later, took home her Grammy for Audrey Hepburn's Enchanted Tales.</p><h2 id=john-legend><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>John Legend</span></h2><p>Whoopi Goldberg previously held the record for shortest timespan to earn an EGOT, however, in 2018, John Legend's Emmy win for Jesus Christ Superstar, allowed him to beat Whoopi's record, however, he still doesn't take the cake!</p><p>While John managed to win himself an array of Grammy's throughout his career, the star won his Oscar and Tony awards in 2015, and 2017 respectively, allowing him to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">secure EGOT status in only 12 years!</a> Considering John is still at the height of his career, it's safe to assume that he might be well on his way to possibly becoming a double EGOT winner.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=robert-lopez><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Robert Lopez</span></h2><p>When it comes to records within the EGOT category, composer, Robert Lopez takes home the win! Not only was Lopez able to secure his EGOT in less than a decade, but he's also one of the few who have taken home the esteemed title more than once.</p><p>Due to his success in film, television, music, and theatre, Robert became the very <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">first double EGOT winner</a> following his success with hit films such as Frozen and Coco, which secured him both a Best Original Song award at the Oscars.</p><h2 id=barbara-streisand><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Barbara Streisand</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Barbara Streisand is regarded as one of the best singers of our time, and rightfully so! The Yentl star has made a name for herself on the big and small screen, all while dominating the theatre and music scene. In 1964, Barbara took home her very first Grammy, and only a year later, her first Emmy. In 1968, Streisand won the Oscar for Best Actress in Funny Girl, leaving her only one award away from EGOT status.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Barbara Streisand Reveals That Her Dogs Are Clones</a></span></p><p>Well, it didn't seem as if a Tony was in the works for Barbara, that is until <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her honorary award in 1970</a>. Barbara was awarded a Special Tony Award, not only securing her EGOT title but doing so in 6 years! Considering Streisand managed with an honorary award, many do not consider her to be the record holder for the shortest time span of reaching such an incredible milestone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=liza-minnelli><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Liza Minnelli</span></h2><p>Much like Barbara Streisand, the incomparable Liza Minnelli also became an EGOT winner when she was honored at the 1990 Grammy's. The star was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">presented with a Grammy Legend Award</a>, 25 years since her Tony win, allowing her to be in great company.</p><p>Liza found most of her success in the 70s where she took home the Oscar for Best Actress in Cabaret in 1972 and an Emmy in 1973 for Liza With A Z. Considering Liza's status in the industry, it's no surprise that she would be amongst the very few EGOT winners, however, when you're born into stardom, it's no surprise!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=james-earl-jones><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>James Earl Jones</span></h2><p>James Earl Jones is just about everybody's favorite! While he is most recognized for his work in The Lion King, Jones is an icon who has appeared in all facets of the entertainment industry. In 1969, James won his very first Tony award, followed by his Grammy nearly a decade later.</p><p>In 1991, James Earl Jones took home not only one, but two Emmys for two separate works, Garbiel's Fire, and Heat Wave. Much like a few other legends in the biz, James scored his EGOT when he was awarded an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Academy Honorary Award in 2011.</a></p><h2 id=quincy-jones><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Quincy Jones</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Quincy Jones is an icon in his own right. The star managed to land himself on the EGOT list after a span of 52 years! In 1964, Quincy won his very first Grammy, one of 28 that is, making him the artist with the most Grammy wins (after 80 nominations).</p><p>In 1977, Jones took home his first Emmy and later the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award at the Oscars in 1994. The legend himself finally reached EGOT status in 2016 when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he won his first Tony</a> for the revival of The Color Purple.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>All-Time Grammy Winners, Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaefpbZus86lm5udopx6sMDHnqlmq6SWv7R51qGmZpmimnqms86tZLChnqOys7%2BO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhoopi-goldberg-other-stars-who-are-egot-winners.html&text=Whoopi%20Goldberg%20%26amp%3b%20Other%20Stars%20Who%20Are%20EGOT%20Winners&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhoopi-goldberg-other-stars-who-are-egot-winners.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhoopi-goldberg-other-stars-who-are-egot-winners.html&title=Whoopi%20Goldberg%20%26amp%3b%20Other%20Stars%20Who%20Are%20EGOT%20Winners" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhoopi-goldberg-other-stars-who-are-egot-winners.html&title=Whoopi%20Goldberg%20%26amp%3b%20Other%20Stars%20Who%20Are%20EGOT%20Winners" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhoopi-goldberg-other-stars-who-are-egot-winners.html&title=Whoopi%20Goldberg%20%26amp%3b%20Other%20Stars%20Who%20Are%20EGOT%20Winners" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhoopi-goldberg-other-stars-who-are-egot-winners.html&description=Whoopi%20Goldberg%20%26amp%3b%20Other%20Stars%20Who%20Are%20EGOT%20Winners" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./adriano-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Adriano Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-jordan-romano-sister-julia-romano-family-ethnicity-and-wife-606534-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Jordan Romano Sister Julia Romano?
