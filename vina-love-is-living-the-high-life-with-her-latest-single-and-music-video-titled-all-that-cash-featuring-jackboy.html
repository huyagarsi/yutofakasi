Planning to inspire listeners to believe in themselves and showcase that we are all able to achieve our dreams if we work hard. This is the follow-up to Vina Love’s single “<a href=#>My City</a>” and Jackboy’s single “Baseball”.</p><p>Vina Love is a singer, dancer, songwriter, video producer and actress, on top of all that, she is also one of the youngest black women to own a recording label, Amore Love Records. She hails from Harlem and attended the Manhattan Theatre Lab High School and the American Music and Dramatic Academy, which have helped to shape the artist she is today, going on to perform alongside some of the biggest names in the music industry, including Ashanti, Megan Thee Stallion, Ja Rule, Fat Joe and many others. Music runs through her blood as her father is Kid Capri, a renowned DJ, producer, and musician who has been active since the ’70s. They both appeared in the reality show “Growing Up Hip Hop NY”. 2017 saw Vina Love drop her debut single “Air”, which was later remixed by Snoop Dogg. She’s gone on to release many more singles, with her collaboration with her father, titled “Uptown”, being her most-streamed single on Spotify with over 110k streams. She’s making an impact on the music industry with her addicting tracks, incredible lyrics, and unforgettable collaborations, she’s certainly the one to watch!</p><p>As for Jackboy, he is a rapper with a huge following, managing to gain over 300 million YouTube views and half a billion Spotify streams, since he launched onto the music scene in 2017. He was born in Haiti but was raised in Pompano Beach, Florida, and has gone on to release a tonne of music without stopping, managing to launch his record label 1804 Records, and dropping four studio albums between 2020 and 2021. His self-titled album “JACKBOY”, which was dropped in 2020, made a massive impact on the music industry, with his single “Pressure” – taken from the album – going on to be certified Gold, it helped to launch his monthly Spotify listener count to over 1 million, and it also propelled him into Rolling Stone’s Top 25 Breakthrough Artist chart. It’s undeniable the star quality that Jackboy has, and we’re sure a worldwide viral hit is just inches away from him and we expect he’ll chart worldwide soon enough.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Watch the official music video to “All That Cash” by Vina Love featuring Jackboy here:</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Written by Da’Vina Love, Jackboy, Kairi Graves, and William Buggs, while it was produced by Wili Hendrixs and Reemix, according to Spotify, “All That Cash” is an addictive hip-hop track that brings epic rap flows from both artists, but allows Vina Love to impress with her R&B style too, blending the two genres brilliantly while allowing the message of the song to inspire listeners. The catchy chorus will certainly be stuck in one’s head after just the first listen, all the while managing to motivate listeners to work hard to achieve their wants and dreams. Vina Love impresses vocally with her sultry R&B vocals mixed around the deep rhythmic beat and her unforgettable rap verses, then Jackboy jumps in with a fired-up verse whilst emphasising Vina Love throughout the track. This is the track we’re going to be playing on repeat for weeks.</p><p>Then there’s the music video, directed by WaveChange and Vina Love, which is mostly filmed with a green filter representing money and cash, as we watch Vina Love being a performer in an adult entertainment club. We watch her put on a show with backing dancers (who are Frida Molina, Kelly Reyes, Shania Sanchez, and Emelin Lebron), as they’re surrounded by money and absolutely nailing the choreography that was created by Kiana Deno. Then Jackboy’s scenes appear during his verse where he exudes personality and goes in hard with his rap, proving why he’s one of the top rising rappers in the industry. Yet, Vina Love shines throughout the video, looking sexy and gorgeous, and working the camera flawlessly. She’s certainly a future star!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Stream the recently released song on Spotify here:</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>“All That Cash”, by Vina Love featuring Jackboy, is available to download and stream, right now, across all platforms, via Amore Love Records.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Let us know what you make of “All That Cash” by Vina Love featuring Jackboy on Twitter <a href=#>@CelebMix</a>.</h4><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51kw6q6wGajqK6VYra0ecuiraKml2LBqbGMoaCgoF2htqexjLCgraBdnbKzecuaq56rpGLAqrrGpZxmmZ6Zeq7B0qKaZq6ZmbKwedOiq6WdlGKurbiMrZ%2BarF2YrrS0jJ%2Bcmqylp7avs4yjmJyjkqTGcA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fvina-love-is-living-the-high-life-with-her-latest-single-and-music-video-titled-all-that-cash-featuring-jackboy.html&text=Vina%20Love%20is%20living%20the%20high%20life%20with%20her%20latest%20single%20and%20music%20video%20titled%20%26quot%3bAll%20That%20Cash%26quot%3b%20feat&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fvina-love-is-living-the-high-life-with-her-latest-single-and-music-video-titled-all-that-cash-featuring-jackboy.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fvina-love-is-living-the-high-life-with-her-latest-single-and-music-video-titled-all-that-cash-featuring-jackboy.html&title=Vina%20Love%20is%20living%20the%20high%20life%20with%20her%20latest%20single%20and%20music%20video%20titled%20%26quot%3bAll%20That%20Cash%26quot%3b%20feat" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fvina-love-is-living-the-high-life-with-her-latest-single-and-music-video-titled-all-that-cash-featuring-jackboy.html&title=Vina%20Love%20is%20living%20the%20high%20life%20with%20her%20latest%20single%20and%20music%20video%20titled%20%26quot%3bAll%20That%20Cash%26quot%3b%20feat" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fvina-love-is-living-the-high-life-with-her-latest-single-and-music-video-titled-all-that-cash-featuring-jackboy.html&title=Vina%20Love%20is%20living%20the%20high%20life%20with%20her%20latest%20single%20and%20music%20video%20titled%20%26quot%3bAll%20That%20Cash%26quot%3b%20feat" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fvina-love-is-living-the-high-life-with-her-latest-single-and-music-video-titled-all-that-cash-featuring-jackboy.html&description=Vina%20Love%20is%20living%20the%20high%20life%20with%20her%20latest%20single%20and%20music%20video%20titled%20%26quot%3bAll%20That%20Cash%26quot%3b%20feat" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-jaye-ladymore-everything-to-know-about-the-actress-from-cws-4400-series.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Jaye Ladymore?
