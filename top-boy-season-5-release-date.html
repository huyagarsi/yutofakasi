Several questions have been raised by fans about the return of Dushane and Sully, as well as the rest of the cast, since the latest season of the Netflix series (Netflix’s second, but fourth altogether) premiered earlier this week.</p><p>First and foremost, we were interested in learning where Jamie, Stef, and Aaron’s parents had ended up. Then we needed some clarification on the show’s conclusion, and finally – and this is the most important question of all – we needed to know whether or not there would be another season of the Netflix show. <strong>This page contains all of the information we have about Top Boy season 5.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Top Boy Season 5</strong> Renewable Status</h2><p>Season 3 of Top Boy will be available on Netflix in 2023.<strong> Season 3 of Top Boy has been officially renewed for 2023.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Top Boy Season 5</strong> Release Date Details</h2><p>The last part of the Top Boy story hasn’t been given a release date yet, but Netflix has confirmed that filming will start this summer. This suggests that it will come out in 2023.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Top Boy Season 5 Expected Cast</strong></h2><p>After making it through another season without a scratch… or at least without too much damage… Ashley Walter’s Dushane and Kane Robinson’s Sully are back for another season. We don’t anticipate them to return because neither of them died.</p><p>Sully (Michael Ward) is exceedingly unlikely to have survived a shot to the head he received, therefore it’s reasonable to assume we’ve seen the last of him.</p><p>As a result of Jamie shooting Kit (Kadeem Ramsay), Jamie’s best friend Kit will also be absent from the show for the remainder of this season.</p><p>Ats (Kenyon Cook), Stef’s best friend, was found dead in the middle of season four, which appears to be a bad period for best friends.</p><p>But the following items should be on the menu again in the near future:</p><ul><li>Aaron (Hope Ikpoku)</li><li>Stef (Araloyin Oshunremi)</li><li>Lauryn (Saffron Hocking)</li><li>Becks (Adwoa Aboa)</li><li>Lizze (Lis Dawson)</li><li>Ruben (Theo Ogundipe)</li><li>Shelly (Little Simz)</li><li>aqs (Jasmine Jobson)</li></ul><p>Pebbles (Erin Kellyman) and Vee (Ava Brennan), who debuted in the show, are expected to return in the future.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Top Boy Season 5 Plot</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Top-Boy-Season-5-Release-Date.jpeg><p>Sure, someone’s going to get a whiff of something. Last season, there was far too much treachery to go without consequences.</p><p>Despite Sully’s best efforts, Dushane and Sully’s relationship appears to be on the rocks. Dushane had planned to retire after handing the drug reins over to Jamie. It’s safe to assume that, now that Sully has scrapped the idea, Dushane won’t take it lying down.</p><p>Assuming, of course, that he isn’t paralyzed by the anxiety he seems to have grown over the course of Season 4. Going the future, it is possible that Dushane’s mental health may become an issue for him to deal with.</p><p>In terms of vengeance, the lengthy stare between Sully and Jamie’s youngest brother Stef was telling – Stef’s astonishment and disbelief were exchanged for grief, a touch of remorse, and perhaps resolution on Sully’s part. Stef and Aaron (Jamie’s other brother) may be interested in resolving the issue.</p><p>Aaron’s future will be intriguing to watch now that he is the earner and Stef’s guardian. Will he abandon his academic pursuits and join Jamie in the streets? ” Season five will provide the answer.</p><p>Not only are Jamie’s brothers bitter, but Jaq’s sister Lauryn may have to keep an eye on her as well. Curtis (Howard Charles) was her controlling and violent ex-boyfriend, so you’d think that killing him would put her out of danger.</p><p>His sister Vee is a much more formidable opponent than Curtis. Still, he’s a crazed dog. She would do anything to revenge for her brother’s death, no matter what. There’s more than just Lauryn’s new kid to worry about for the actress.</p><p>Shelly, Dushane’s girlfriend, carries at least one skeleton in her closet that we know about and that could come bursting out at any moment. In order to cover up her ex-violent boyfriend’s activities, she dug up the body and disposed of it. However, her blackmailer (who also happens to be the victim’s ex-girlfriend) could ruin things for her in the upcoming season if she makes her a target of his attention.</p><p>One must untangle innumerable knots. Season five has to get here as soon as possible. We’re very excited!</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong></p><ul><li><a title="Ending of The Gilded Age Season 1 Explained and Finale Recap (In Details)" href=# rel=bookmark>Ending of The Gilded Age Season 1 Explained and Finale Recap (In Details)</a></li><li><a title="Ghosts Season 4 Release Date, Renewed Status, Cast, Plot & Other Details" href=# rel=bookmark>Ghosts Season 4 Release Date, Renewed Status, Cast, Plot & Other Details</a></li><li><a title="‘The Afterparty’ Renewed For Season 2: Everything We Know So Far in 2022" href=# rel=bookmark>‘The Afterparty’ Renewed For Season 2: Everything We Know So Far in 2022</a></li><li><a title="Endeavour Season 9 Release Date, Renewed Status, Cast, Plot & Other Details" href=# rel=bookmark>Endeavour Season 9 Release Date, Renewed Status, Cast, Plot & Other Details</a></li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Top Boy Season 5 Trailer</strong></h2><p>No, but be prepared for a lengthy investigation when it does! <strong>you can watch the previous season 4 trailer.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfmru1sdGtmKKmnZq7tXvTqKdmmp%2BuerSxwKymp2VlYr%2BmuMSaqp5llJbBpns%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftop-boy-season-5-release-date.html&text=Top%20Boy%20Season%205%20Premiere%20Date%20%26amp%3b%20Renewed%20Status%3a%20Everything%20We%20Know%20So%20Far%21&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftop-boy-season-5-release-date.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftop-boy-season-5-release-date.html&title=Top%20Boy%20Season%205%20Premiere%20Date%20%26amp%3b%20Renewed%20Status%3a%20Everything%20We%20Know%20So%20Far%21" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftop-boy-season-5-release-date.html&title=Top%20Boy%20Season%205%20Premiere%20Date%20%26amp%3b%20Renewed%20Status%3a%20Everything%20We%20Know%20So%20Far%21" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftop-boy-season-5-release-date.html&title=Top%20Boy%20Season%205%20Premiere%20Date%20%26amp%3b%20Renewed%20Status%3a%20Everything%20We%20Know%20So%20Far%21" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftop-boy-season-5-release-date.html&description=Top%20Boy%20Season%205%20Premiere%20Date%20%26amp%3b%20Renewed%20Status%3a%20Everything%20We%20Know%20So%20Far%21" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./alicia-quarles-and-michael-ross.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alicia Quarles and Michael Ross">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./tabria-majors-bio-career-family-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tabria Majors Bio: Career, Family &amp;amp; Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
