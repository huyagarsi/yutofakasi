The 7-foot-1 Superstar has used his considerable height to his advantage both on the basketball court and in his love life. Shaquille has had a handful of love interests over the years, including his <a href=#>ex-wife and Basketball Wives star Shaunie O'Neal</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The pair <a href=#>share four children together</a>: sons Shareef and Shaqir and daughters Amirah and Me'arah.

They got back together soon after separating but officially called it quits in 2009. It seems that Shaq's height didn't bother his ex-wife at all. In an interview with Access Hollywood, when discussing his & hers bathrooms, Shaunie lightheartedly asked Shaquille O'Neal "Why do you need a bigger bathroom?" Shaquille answered "cause I got a bigger a** than you" instantly making Shaunie laugh.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Were All The Women In Shaquille O'Neal's Life?</a></span></p><p>Shaunie O'Neal once said, "Everyone's always surprised that I'm not short.

Then again, most people would look small when compared to the 7-foot-1 athlete, who has an impressively large shoe size of 22.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/shaq1.jpg><p>While Shaquille O'Neal is no longer married to Shaunie, the two have gone on to co-parent their children together and have remained good friends.

She went on to add "We both support each other, I used to tease him and be like 'Could you please hurry up and get a wife?' and then you could stop randomly face-timing me talking about your day" she joked about the star's habit of randomly calling her.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#> Why Shaquille O'Neal Blames Himself Over The Divorce From His Ex-Wife Shaunie</a></span></p><p>Shaquille O'Neal has been nothing short of graceful when discussing his relationship with his ex-wife to the press, even blaming himself for the failure of their marriage. During Shaq's appearance on The Pivot Podcast, he addressed his mistakes and claimed that the divorce was all his fault. "I was bad, she was awesome" he revealed. "She did exactly what she was supposed to do and gave me beautiful kids, take care of the house, take care of the corporate stuff.

The first woman he was linked to after finalizing his divorce from ex-wife Shaunie O'Neal was Flavor of Love star Nicole "Hoopz" Alexander, the two dated from the summer of 2010 to 2012.</p><p>The height difference between Shaquille O'Neal and his ex-girlfriend Nicole Alexander was so vast that the two often went viral when pictured on outings together. Standing at 7-foot-1 and weighing 300+ lbs, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shaquille O'Neal towers over most women</a> (and men for that matter). However, when pictured next to Alexander's petite and shorter-than-average 5-foot-2 frame, the couple's height difference was extremely apparent and nothing short of shocking.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#> 15 Pics That Paint Shaquille O'Neal In A Different Light</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2011, the duo were spotted shopping in Calabasas, California.

When commenting on the couple's significant height difference, The comedian showed a picture of the two together and said "It looks to me as if you're taking your daughter to kindergarten, how does this even work?" instantly earning laughs from the crowd.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"She's a fabulous lady, she's strong, and believe it or not, she can carry me on her back," Shaq replied, leaving Jimmy Kimmel looking dumbfounded. "Really?" Kimmel questioned, which led to Nicole getting on stage and showing the audience just that. The reality star gave her NBA ex-boyfriend a piggyback ride - and in high heels! She impressively made it to ten steps before collapsing and falling onto the floor with O'Neal following in tow. The audience cheers were wild for Nicole, and Jimmy commended the flavor of love star, saying "Wow, that's impressive, she is strong".</p><p>Despite being a charismatic couple, the pair ended their relationship in 2012 after mediatakeout.com reported that the couple got into a heated argument in front of several children at a gymnastics training center in Florida.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shaquille O'Neal has been linked to various other women including <a href=#>author Karrine Steffans, reality star Laura Govan</a> and model Laticia Rolle who he dated from 2014 to 2018.
