He said the YouTuber physically abused him on several instances and repeatedly beat him on the head.&nbsp;</p><p>Sunhatkid claimed Duncan asked him to sign a ten-year YouTube contract with him and made him unfollow all the social media influencers he knew.&nbsp;</p><p>The contract restricted him from collaborating with other content creators. Further, he claimed Duncan allegedly took 20% of his earnings.&nbsp;</p><p>Sunhatkid, elaborating about the physical abuse part, stated the YouTube star gave him a big lump on the head during a friendly wrestling session. The hit also caused him to bleed.&nbsp;</p><p>In another instance, Duncan reportedly kicked him in the head after he failed at a skateboarding trick.</p><p>Things started to get only worse for Sunhatkid as he claimed Duncan cornered him in a bathroom one day and placed a knife at his throat.&nbsp;</p><p>Although Duncan did not stab him with the weapon this particular incident really frightened him and had him scared for his life.&nbsp;</p><p>The former Duncan employee also claimed that nobody in the team cared what Duncan was doing to him as the alleged abuse often happened in front of others.&nbsp;</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>it’s obvious danny duncan is a bully from his arrogant behavior on camera.
