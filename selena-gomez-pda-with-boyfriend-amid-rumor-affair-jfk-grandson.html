This power move has proven to be incredibly lucrative for her.</p><p>Schlossberg is a lawyer who graduated from Harvard University. But for those thinking this was a great coupling, Gomez saw the chatter and quickly shut down the idea. In response to a post on Instagram about publications linking her and Schlossberg, Gomez commented, "Never met this human sorry." <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She quickly ended any further gossip</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-have-selena-gomez-39-s-fans-said-about-the-dating-rumors>What Have Selena Gomez's Fans Said About The Dating Rumors?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/selena-gomez-boyfriend-1.jpg><p><strong>Fans had previously reacted to the post, though, with some comparing Schlossberg to her current boyfriend, Bennie Blanco</strong>. "This Kennedy guy was a better option than her present!" one comment reads. Another fan wrote, "I love Selena, but I think Selena is a hopeless romantic and falls for any guy that is a little nice to her."</p><p>Other fans showed their support. "@selenagomez, these rumors are CRAZY. Well, either way, Love you, girl," one comment reads. But there was also a lot of confusion. "Wait, what? He cannot promise her the White House it isn't his private property," a comment reads.

"I think most of my experiences in relationships have been cursed. I've been way too young to be exposed to certain things when I was in relationships," she told Vogue Australia in an interview in 2021.</p><p>"I guess I needed to find what was that word for me because I felt so less than in past relationships and never really felt equal," Gomez continued about why she named her makeup line Rare Beauty. "And so that word to me – when I first heard it [used in the single Rare] with Nolan [Lambroza], one of the writers, I just said this is what I want to feel about myself. So it wasn't even necessarily like: 'Oh, I feel that way, let me sing it.'

"They are so in love," an insider told People in April 2024. "It's a very serious relationship, and they're making long-distance work while she's in New York for work commitments."</p><p>The insider continued, "Benny makes her feel special, and they try to see each other as much as possible.
