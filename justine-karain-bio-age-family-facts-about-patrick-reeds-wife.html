One of those exceptions is Justine Karain, wife of the 2018 Master Tournament Winner, Patrick Reed. Her husband’s achievements in the game of Golf have brought her before the public eye; making her the subject of thousands of google searches. This post takes a peek into her bio, age, family, and other interesting facts there is to know about her.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=justine-karain-%e2%80%93-bio-age></span><strong>Justine Karain – Bio (Age)</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Justine Karain was born in Houston, Texas on December 19, 1986. Although not too many details exist about her early childhood, family and education, we do know that she was born into an affluent family and that she has a brother by the name Kessler Karain. She attended Klein Forest High School where she helped start the women’s Golf team. This would be Justine’s earliest ‘swipe’ at Golfing.</p><p>After graduating from high school, Justine Karain then attended Louisiana State University for Health Service Administration for her undergraduate education. She then proceeded to Augusta State University, where she earned another degree in Nursing. Asides being an A-student, Karain was also an excellent swimmer and played soccer during her high school days.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=career></span><strong>Career</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Justine Karain’s career began as a health worker, specifically as a caregiver, otherwise known as a caddie. As a requirement for full ‘caddie-ship,’ she worked full-time as a nurse in training. It was within this time at Augusta University that she met and caddied for Patrick Reed in the two years that followed. She was, however, replaced by her brother Kessler when she became pregnant with their first child. She soon switched roles from health worker to her husband’s biggest full-time supporter on and off course. However, as motherhood responsibilities slowly crept in, she was no longer readily available on the golf course to cheer her husband up. She focused on raising their two kids, instead.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=justine-karains-family-husband-and-kids></span> <strong>Justine Karain’s </strong><strong>Family: Husband and Kids</strong><br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Justine Karain and Patrick Reed have a close-knit family. Upon their first meeting in 2009, the pair began an affectionate relationship that lasted three years before taking it a notch higher with their engagement on January 9, 2012. They were married months later in a private wedding ceremony on December 21, 2012.</p><p>The immediate family may be close, warm and happy. However, the same isn’t true when you begin to consider Justine’s relationship with her in-laws. Patrick Reed’s marriage to Justine Karain have been strongly opposed by his parents who he continues to keep out of his life by all means. It all started with their dislike for Karain. Plus, Patrick was just 22 when he married Justine Karain and his parents reportedly considered the two to be too young to get married when they did. Asides blacklisting them from their wedding ceremony, Patrick had once asked that his parents be removed from the course in the 2014 U.S. open where they came to watch him play.</p><p>Consequently, Justine Karain does not have a thriving relationship with her in-laws and have even criticized them publicly for the supposed physical and verbal abuse they put Patrick through when he was growing up.</p><p>So far their marriage has produced two children, a daughter they christened Windsor-Wells (b. May 2014) and a son, Barrett Benjamin, born on December 6, 2017.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=other-interesting-facts-about-patrick-reeds-wife></span><strong>Other Interesting Facts About Patrick Reed’s Wife</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h4><strong>1. She is a Trained Athlete</strong></h4><p>While it’s certain that Justine Karain has no ambitions being a professional golfer, she also has a history of her own in sports. We mentioned earlier that she was a competitive soccer player, swimmer, and golfer during her days in high school and part of her college days. She continues to support her husband who, so far has twice won the European Tour and bagged multiple wins in the PGA Tour. His biggest win yet came in 2018 when he emerged victorious in the Masters Tournament.</p><h4><strong>2. </strong><strong>Justine Karain’s </strong><strong>Salary and Net Worth</strong><br></h4><p>As far as specifics go, we’ve caught no wind of her personal net worth or salary yet. However, we do know that as of 2019 her husband, Patrick Reed’s net worth stands at over $9 million.</p><h4><strong>3. Brush With Death</strong></h4><p>Justine Karain had her own near-death experience back in 2014 when she had a seizure in a bathtub that almost made her drown. Save for the quick response of her husband and the paramedics who had her transported to a nearby hospital, Justine would’ve become another memory today.</p><h4><strong>4. Height and Body Measurement</strong></h4><p>Although we have no details regarding her height, body measurements, shoe, bra, and dress sizes, we’re aware that Justine Karain is of average height (not as her husband who is about 6 feet tall). Also, she has blond hair.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKKlqMGqusRmopqqkZ67bq7IqGSan5Vis6K5yKWwZp6RmMG0ecCbpq6sXaWutb7InKJmqpWasbR51qKdnmc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjustine-karain-bio-age-family-facts-about-patrick-reeds-wife.html&text=Justine%20Karain%20%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Family%2c%20Facts%20About%20Patrick%20Reeds%20Wife&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjustine-karain-bio-age-family-facts-about-patrick-reeds-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjustine-karain-bio-age-family-facts-about-patrick-reeds-wife.html&title=Justine%20Karain%20%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Family%2c%20Facts%20About%20Patrick%20Reeds%20Wife" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjustine-karain-bio-age-family-facts-about-patrick-reeds-wife.html&title=Justine%20Karain%20%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Family%2c%20Facts%20About%20Patrick%20Reeds%20Wife" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjustine-karain-bio-age-family-facts-about-patrick-reeds-wife.html&title=Justine%20Karain%20%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Family%2c%20Facts%20About%20Patrick%20Reeds%20Wife" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjustine-karain-bio-age-family-facts-about-patrick-reeds-wife.html&description=Justine%20Karain%20%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Family%2c%20Facts%20About%20Patrick%20Reeds%20Wife" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./new-on-peacock-movies-shows-originals-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="New on Peacock: January 2024">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./how-much-money-does-luenell-make-latest-luenell-net-worth-income-salary.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Much Money Does Luenell Make?
