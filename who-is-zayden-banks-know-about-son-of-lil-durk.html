He is the son of&nbsp; Lil Durk. Durk’s children, Bella, Angelo, and Zayden, attend school and engage in various activities. This is precisely how Lil envisioned his children to be. Angelo Banks is the eldest son, while Bella Banks is the eldest daughter. Zayden is the middle kid, yet he is one of the most adorable. Zayden recently went to his sister’s event, a theater performance in which she dressed up as a blue butterfly. She looked beautiful in her outfit. Siblings often attend enjoyable activities, such as ice skating circles. They had a great time.</p><p>The kids seem to be well-mannered and lovely. Lil seems to be doing an excellent job as a parent. Zayden and Angelo seem to like sports, particularly basketball. Bella seems to be sweet, lively, and inventive. Durk has left no stone unturned when it comes to parenting his children and creating a healthy and secure environment for them. A father with a terrible background is doing all he can to raise his children properly.</p><h2>Zayden Banks Height & Weight</h2><p>This famous child is still in his formative years. His precise physical dimensions are not revealed. However, as of now, <strong>he stands 2 ft 9 inches</strong> and weighs 30 kg. He also has lovely black eyes and black hair.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Zayden-Banks.jpg><h2>Why Zayden’s father does not want him to live on the streets?</h2><p>Durk has a total of six children. When he had his first kid, he was just 17 years old. Skyler Banks (with Tameka Kute), Angelo Banks (with Nicole Covone), Willow Banks (with India Royale), Du’mier Banks (Mother unknown), and Bella Banks are his other five siblings (with Nicole Covone). Durk’s upbringing was riddled with misdemeanors. He was involved in stealing and violence. His father was likewise engaged in criminal activity in Chicago. Lil’s father had abandoned him. His father left him when he was just seven months old. Durk had been thinking about creating a satisfying life for the people he cared about. Durk’s second kid is Zayden. He has always given his all to provide for his children and wants them to have everything he did not have as a youngster.</p><p>Lil does not want his children to be associated with the streets or criminality. He has also said that he wishes for his children to be intelligent. Zayden wants kids to read books, play games, and participate in sports. He doesn’t want kids to know anything about gangs or life on the streets. Lil has also said that he wishes for his children to live outside Chicago. This is due to an increase in gang activity in the city. He wishes for a better atmosphere for his children.</p><h2>Durk’s father is still imprisoned.</h2><p>When Lil Durk was little, Dontay Banks abandoned him. Dontay has spent his whole life involved in criminal activity. He is presently serving two consecutive life sentences. He has virtually little prospect of ever living a free life anymore.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Zayden-Banks-1.png><h2>The case of Lil Durk</h2><p>Dontay was convicted of a firearms offense in 2011. As a result, he is sentenced to three months in jail. He was let free, but he did not change. This resulted in additional 87-day imprisonment for him. His deeds did not end there. He was detained while carrying a loaded 40 caliber handgun. Police stopped him in his vehicle. This occurred on South Green Lane in Chicago. He was charged with unlawful use of firearms and was released on a $100,000 bail.</p><h2>Net worth 2023</h2><p>Like other well-known children is without a source of income. In terms of his parents’ net worth, his father, <strong>Durk, is believed to have a net worth of $3 million as of December 2023.</strong></p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuxsCym56mXZeur7fSZqKnp6dirqO71K1krKeeYrynecuio2acpae4cA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-zayden-banks-know-about-son-of-lil-durk.html&text=Who%20is%20Zayden%20Banks%3f%20Know%20About%20Son%20Of%20Lil%20Durk.&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-zayden-banks-know-about-son-of-lil-durk.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-zayden-banks-know-about-son-of-lil-durk.html&title=Who%20is%20Zayden%20Banks%3f%20Know%20About%20Son%20Of%20Lil%20Durk." target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-zayden-banks-know-about-son-of-lil-durk.html&title=Who%20is%20Zayden%20Banks%3f%20Know%20About%20Son%20Of%20Lil%20Durk." target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-zayden-banks-know-about-son-of-lil-durk.html&title=Who%20is%20Zayden%20Banks%3f%20Know%20About%20Son%20Of%20Lil%20Durk." target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-zayden-banks-know-about-son-of-lil-durk.html&description=Who%20is%20Zayden%20Banks%3f%20Know%20About%20Son%20Of%20Lil%20Durk." target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./22-savage-net-worth-2020-2021.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="22 Savage Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Dating, Bio-Wiki">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./uruguay-head-coach-oscar-tabarez-dismissed-after-15-years-in-role.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Uruguay head coach Oscar Tabarez dismissed after 15 years in role">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
