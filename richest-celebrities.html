The arrest occurred just hours before he was scheduled to perform as part of a Nipsey Hussle tribute at the Grammys.

YG insisted he had nothing to do with the incident and was many miles away at the time of the shooting at a Hollywood recording studio. Over twitter YG claimed:</p><p><strong>"I was nowhere near the scene of this incident, I was in Hollywood recording in the studio all day. I was there until after midnight on the 4th of July and didn't learn of these events until after they happened!"</strong></p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>For a time, YG was renting one of <a href=# title="Tyler Perry Net Worth">Tyler Perry</a>'s homes in the Hollywood Hills.

One of the inhabitants was arrested on a weapons charge.</p><p>In May 2019 he paid just under $3 million for a large mansion in Chatsworth, California. It was at this home where YG was arrested in January 2020.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70aKaoZ2jqXqzrc%2BpnKurX660brrErWSwp6KptXA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2frichest-celebrities.html&text=YG%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frichest-celebrities.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2frichest-celebrities.html&title=YG%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2frichest-celebrities.html&title=YG%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2frichest-celebrities.html&title=YG%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frichest-celebrities.html&description=YG%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./is-paul-james-married-to-a-wife-i-love-that-for-you-cast-relationship-and-dating-history-288405-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Paul James Married To A Wife?
