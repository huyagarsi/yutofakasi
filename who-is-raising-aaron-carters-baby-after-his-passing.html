The singer’s death is especially tragic, given that he leaves behind an 11-month-old son, Prince, who he shared with <a href=#>his on-and-off fiancé Melanie Martin</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Both Aaron and Melanie reportedly struggled with substance abuse and had several domestic violence incidents over the years. The couple lost custody of their son mere months before Aaron’s untimely death, which has led to speculation over who will raise the baby now. Here’s what we know about Melanie’s current custody situation.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Does Emma Roberts Think Of Her Ex Evan Peters' Success?</a></span></p><h2 id=aaron-carter-lost-custody-of-his-son-right-before-his-death>Aaron Carter Lost Custody Of His Son Right Before His Death</h2><p>Only two months before his death, it was reported that Aaron had checked into rehab after losing custody of his son, then 9-months old. The former child star gave an interview to <a href=#>The Sun</a> in which he provided details of the voluntary program, which wasn’t court mandated.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“It’s an abstinence program and I work with an individual counselor,” he explained.</p><p>“I do group therapy, parenting classes, domestic violence classes. I got myself certified in CPR, just a lot of different things,” Aaron continued.</p><p>Aaron and his fiancé Melanie Martin had lost custody of the baby amid substance abuse and domestic violence concerns. At the time, it was reported Prince was in the temporary custody of his maternal grandmother.</p><h2 id=aaron-carter-and-his-fianc-eacute-melanie-martin-always-had-a-chaotic-relationship>Aaron Carter And His Fiancé Melanie Martin Always Had A Chaotic Relationship</h2><p>Months before they lost custody, Melanie accused Aaron of fracturing her ribs during a February 2021 altercation. The pair were reportedly not together at the time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Court documents reveal that Melanie says they began arguing when Aaron learned she saw someone else during a break. “We had a fight about me talking to another man while we were broken up,” she stated.</p><p>She went on to claim that Aaron then kicked her and their son out of his L.A. home.</p><p>“He tried to threaten me with a fake allegation if I didn’t leave after, and all my things were still at the house, and my baby as well. So, we were thrown out on the streets, had to stay at a friend’s and file this report after the doctor’s visit,” Melanie claimed.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The 16 Most Expensive Celebrity Weddings</a></span></p><p>The influencer also says she believes Aaron’s aggressive behavior was caused by substance abuse. “I think that during the days of our break-up, he took too many of his prescription pills and it gave him too much aggression,” she said, court documents reveal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“He probably doesn’t even remember he did so,” Melanie continued “I think he needs anger management, counseling on how to control his anger. He is very jealous and needs to be more rational because he doesn’t even remember he did so I believe.”</p><p>Following the incident, child protective services reportedly got involved. Melanie claimed it was in their son’s best interest that she has primary custody, and Prince not be left in the care of his father. Ultimately, however, both parents lost custodial rights months after.</p><p>Then, in December 2021, <a href=#>Aaron claimed that Melanie wouldn’t leave his house</a> despite being broken up. This happened only a week after their son was born. But the couple apparently reconciled shortly after the online debacle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=melanie-martin-is-planning-to-be-a-single-mom-but-needs-custody-first>Melanie Martin Is Planning To Be A Single Mom, But Needs Custody First</h2><p>At this time, it’s unclear who is caring for Aaron and Melanie’s son. It’s likely that the baby’s maternal grandmother is still his temporary guardian, as there haven’t been any recent updates about the custody situation. Though he was still enrolled in rehab, Aaron was reportedly struggling with his program leading up to his death. <a href=#>TMZ</a> reports that he missed his final therapy session before he died.</p><p>The publication adds that Prince is currently being cared for by Melanie’s mom, so it appears neither Aaron or Melanie were able to gain custody back prior to his death.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Will Johnny Depp Ever Get Married Again?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Melanie has referenced their son in her public reaction to Aaron’s death, mentioning how difficult it’ll be to raise their child without his father’s involvement. Based on her words, it seems Melanie intends to raise her son herself, despite the custody situation. It also appears she and Aaron were together at the time of his death.</p><p>“My heart is completely broken over the passing of my fiancé Aaron. I knew he was struggling, and I tried everything to help him,” she told <a href=#>PEOPLE</a>. “I only wish I had more people to help me with him. I will now be raising our son as a single mother and this is the worst day of my life, but I have to be strong for our son. I’m devastated.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuvsCiqqKml2Kuor7Op2ScmaKpsrO%2FjJuYm7FdlrO1sdFmn6KrXaWutL%2FIp55o</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-raising-aaron-carters-baby-after-his-passing.html&text=Whos%20Raising%20Aaron%20Carters%20Baby%20After%20His%20Passing%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-raising-aaron-carters-baby-after-his-passing.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-raising-aaron-carters-baby-after-his-passing.html&title=Whos%20Raising%20Aaron%20Carters%20Baby%20After%20His%20Passing%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-raising-aaron-carters-baby-after-his-passing.html&title=Whos%20Raising%20Aaron%20Carters%20Baby%20After%20His%20Passing%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-raising-aaron-carters-baby-after-his-passing.html&title=Whos%20Raising%20Aaron%20Carters%20Baby%20After%20His%20Passing%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-raising-aaron-carters-baby-after-his-passing.html&description=Whos%20Raising%20Aaron%20Carters%20Baby%20After%20His%20Passing%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./green-sauce-in-italian-cooking-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Green sauce in Italian cooking">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./hovig-gravity-acoustic.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hovig releases acoustic version of &amp;quot;Gravity&amp;quot;">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
