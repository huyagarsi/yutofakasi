In this role, he worked with many different celebrities, including the infamous Taylor Swift. When it came time for Swift to host the network program, she threw a curveball at the writing staff, which included Meyers and the show's producer.</p><p>In an interview, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Seth Meyers detailed how 19-year-old Taylor Swift came into her first day as host</a> and announced that she had already prepared her monologue, which she presented in song form.
