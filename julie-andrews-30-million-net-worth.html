She has appeared in some of the most famous film musicals of all time, and is perhaps best remembered for her turns as Maria in The Sound of Music and the eponymous character in Mary Poppins. Younger audiences may know her better <a href=#>from The Princess Diaries, in which she starred alongside Anne Hathaway</a>. Andrews has enjoyed massive success over the course of her decades-long career, and for her work has received just about every entertainment award imaginable, including an Academy Award for her work on Mary Poppins. Her unique voice has made her one of the most successful musical stars in the world, and has allowed her to continue working - often providing voice work for major animated films. She is <a href=#>one of the most beloved stars in the business</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything Anne Hathaway and Julie Andrews Have Said About 'The Princess Diaries'</a></span></p><p>But how has all this acclaim translated financially?

The removal was botched, however, leaving her voice permanently damaged. In 1999, she took on the doctors who had performed the procedure, suing for malpractice which has robbed her of her livelihood and caused intense emotional anguish.

Despite this terrible setback, however, the actress has found new means of artistic expression, and in recent years has entered into a variety of new ventures. She is author of a successful series of children’s books, and has also worked on Julie’s Greenroom, a Netflix show featuring ‘Ms Julie’ and a host of colorful puppets which has been a huge success on the platform.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her voice has also been heard on Bridgerton, where she performs as the narrator, Lady Whistledown.
